            <p><span class="speaker">TOMMASO:</span> 23rd of October, 2024. Custodia Ultimae Vocis. Isolation Chamber Three. [cite_start]Father Tommaso Lanza analyzing Case TM-2024-051[cite: 1].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The human body is roughly seventy percent water[cite: 2]. [cite_start]Forty liters on average[cite: 2].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>I- I kept thinking about that while reading Dr. Whitmore's report[cite: 3]. [cite_start]All that water just... sitting inside us[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Moving through us[cite: 4]. [cite_start]We don't really think about it[cite: 4].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine Walsh thought about it[cite: 5]. [cite_start]By the end, I think it's all she could think about[cite: 5].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Let's take a step back[cite: 6].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Hopkins hospice[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Pancreatic cancer, stage four[cite: 7]. [cite_start]The kind that spreads fast[cite: 7]. [cite_start]Liver involvement, kidney involvement[cite: 7].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>They gave her days when she was admitted[cite: 8]. [cite_start]A week at most[cite: 8].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Room 447, third floor, east wing[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Standard hospice accommodation[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Single bed, vitals monitor that beeped every eight seconds, IV stand[cite: 9]. [cite_start]Window facing the parking lot[cite: 10]. [cite_start]The air had that particular hospice smell - disinfectant trying to cover something else[cite: 10].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>She refused morphine[cite: 11]. [cite_start]The staff found this unusual - pancreatic cancer is painful, especially at that stage[cite: 11]. [cite_start]But Catherine was insistent[cite: 12]. [cite_start]She told the nurses the medication made everything blurry, made it hard to focus[cite: 12]. [cite_start]She needed to stay alert[cite: 13]. [cite_start]Needed to keep watching[cite: 13].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>They noted it in her chart[cite: 14]. [cite_start]"Patient refusing pain management despite evident discomfort[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Mental status: anxious, hypervigilant[cite: 14]. [cite_start]Refuses to close eyes for extended periods"[cite: 14].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine had one request when she arrived[cite: 15]. [cite_start]Just one thing she wanted[cite: 15].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Her daughter Emily had to bring an iPad from home[cite: 16]. [cite_start]Catherine wanted it set up at the foot of her bed, propped on the meal tray table[cite: 17]. [cite_start]Angled just right so she could see it clearly[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Emily brought in a phone charger with a long cord[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Catherine was very specific about that: the device needed to stay on[cite: 19]. [cite_start]Constantly[cite: 19]. [cite_start]No interruptions[cite: 19].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The nursing staff thought it was harmless[cite: 20]. [cite_start]They'd had patients watch cooking shows, nature documentaries, family videos on loop[cite: 20]. [cite_start]Comfort during difficult times and this seemed no different[cite: 21].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>What she wanted to watch was a livestream from Oregon[cite: 22]. [cite_start]One of those ambient video feeds people put online[cite: 22]. [cite_start]Just a camera pointed at a river[cite: 23]. [cite_start]Water moving over rocks, trees overhead, bird sounds[cite: 23]. [cite_start]The kind of thing people have on in the background while they work[cite: 24].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine watched it for twenty-one days straight[cite: 25].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily's account describes the first few days as almost normal[cite: 26]. [cite_start]Her mother seemed calm watching the river[cite: 26]. [cite_start]Peaceful[cite: 26]. [cite_start]The hospice staff thought it was helping with her anxiety about dying[cite: 27]. [cite_start]Some people want music, some want family photos, some want nature sounds[cite: 28]. [cite_start]Catherine wanted a river[cite: 28].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>But on the third day, Emily noticed her mother wasn't blinking as much[cite: 29]. [cite_start]She'd stare at the screen for longer and longer periods[cite: 30]. [cite_start]Emily timed it once: four minutes without blinking[cite: 30]. [cite_start]Catherine's eyes would tear up from dryness but she wouldn't look away[cite: 31].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily asked if she wanted to watch something else[cite: 32]. [cite_start]A movie, maybe or some family videos[cite: 32]. [cite_start]Catherine said no[cite: 32]. [cite_start]She had to keep watching[cite: 33]. [cite_start]She couldn't miss it[cite: 33].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>On day seven, Emily tried turning the iPad off while her mother slept[cite: 34]. [cite_start]Just to give it a rest, charge it properly[cite: 35]. [cite_start]Catherine woke up immediately[cite: 36]. [cite_start]Emily said it was like an alarm had gone off[cite: 36]. [cite_start]Her mother's eyes opened and she reached for the iPad with surprising strength[cite: 37]. [cite_start]Made Emily turn it back on[cite: 37]. [cite_start]Waited until the stream loaded and the water was moving again before she'd let Emily leave[cite: 38]. [cite_start]After that, the iPad stayed on constantly[cite: 39].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>By the second week, Catherine stopped sleeping more than fifteen, twenty minutes at a time[cite: 40]. [cite_start]The staff was concerned, sleep deprivation in hospice patients usually means increased pain, confusion[cite: 41]. [cite_start]But Catherine seemed focused[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Alert[cite: 41]. [cite_start]Just watching the water[cite: 42].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily asked what she was watching for[cite: 43]. [cite_start]What she was waiting to see[cite: 43]. [cite_start]Catherine told her the water was pretending[cite: 44]. [cite_start]That it flows to look natural, to look random[cite: 44]. [cite_start]But if you watch it long enough without blinking, you can see the movement isn't real[cite: 45]. [cite_start]You can see that something is performing[cite: 46]. [cite_start]Catherine said: Water flows because if it stays still, we'd see what it actually is[cite: 47].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily thought it was the liver failure[cite: 48]. [cite_start]Ammonia building up in her mother's blood[cite: 48]. [cite_start]The doctors agreed[cite: 49]. [cite_start]They increased her anti-nausea medication, adjusted her care plan[cite: 49]. [cite_start]Standard end-stage delirium, they said[cite: 49].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>But Emily noticed something else[cite: 50]. [cite_start]Her mother was gaining weight[cite: 51]. [cite_start]The medical notes show Catherine's weight went up two kilograms between days nineteen and twenty-one[cite: 52]. [cite_start]This doesn't happen[cite: 53]. [cite_start]When your kidneys are failing, when you're dying, you lose weight[cite: 53]. [cite_start]You stop eating, stop drinking[cite: 53]. [cite_start]Your body consumes itself[cite: 53]. [cite_start]Catherine's body was filling up[cite: 54].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Day fourteen[cite: 55]. [cite_start]The nurse wrote: "Patient's face is swollen[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Eyes puffy like she's been crying for hours, but she hasn't[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Tried to examine her, but she became upset[cite: 55]. [cite_start]Wouldn't look away from the screen"[cite: 55].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>Day sixteen[cite: 56]. [cite_start]Dr. Whitmore tried to check Catherine's legs and back[cite: 56]. [cite_start]She wrote: "Patient's ankles are swollen[cite: 57]. [cite_start]When I pressed my thumb into the flesh, it sank in easily[cite: 57]. [cite_start]Like pushing into cold butter[cite: 57]. [cite_start]The indent stayed there for minutes after I pulled away[cite: 57]. [cite_start]The skin didn't spring back[cite: 57]. [cite_start]Just stayed pressed in, holding the shape of my thumb"[cite: 57].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Day eighteen[cite: 58]. [cite_start]The nurse's notes get more detailed: "Patient's skin has become translucent[cite: 58]. [cite_start]In certain light, appears almost see-through[cite: 58]. [cite_start]Like wax paper that's gotten wet[cite: 58]. [cite_start]Visible fluid movement beneath surface[cite: 58]. [cite_start]After blood pressure check, cuff marks remained visible for ten minutes, deep grooves in flesh[cite: 58]. [cite_start]Tissue consistency similar to wet clay"[cite: 58].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily noticed her mother's hands changing[cite: 59]. [cite_start]The fingers getting thicker[cite: 59]. [cite_start]Swollen[cite: 59]. [cite_start]The skin stretched so tight it looked shiny[cite: 59]. [cite_start]When Catherine gripped the iPad to adjust the angle, Emily said she could see something shift under the skin[cite: 60]. [cite_start]Fluid, moving from her knuckles down to her wrist[cite: 61]. [cite_start]Rippling[cite: 61]. [cite_start]Like her mother's hands were full of water instead of blood and muscle[cite: 62].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Day nineteen[cite: 63]. [cite_start]Dr. Whitmore pressed her fingers into Catherine's forearm to check the swelling[cite: 63]. [cite_start]Standard procedure[cite: 63]. [cite_start]You press down, the fluid is supposed to move away from your fingers[cite: 64]. [cite_start]Spread out to the sides[cite: 64]. [cite_start]Catherine's didn't[cite: 65]. [cite_start]The water moved toward the pressure[cite: 66]. [cite_start]Gathered under Dr. Whitmore's fingers[cite: 66]. [cite_start]Like it was curious[cite: 66]. [cite_start]Like it wanted to touch back[cite: 67].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Day twenty[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Morning shift[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Nurse Angela Miller had to reach across Catherine to adjust the IV[cite: 68]. [cite_start]Her arm passed between Catherine and the screen[cite: 69]. [cite_start]Catherine's hand shot out[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Grabbed Angela's wrist[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Hard enough that Angela screamed[cite: 70]. [cite_start]Five bruises[cite: 71]. [cite_start]Dark ones[cite: 71]. [cite_start]The kind that last for weeks[cite: 71]. [cite_start]Emily said her mother's grip was too hard, too firm[cite: 72]. [cite_start]Like Catherine's fingers weren't fingers anymore, like they were packed full of something, pressurized[cite: 73]. [cite_start]Angela said later that it felt like squeezing an overfilled water balloon[cite: 74]. [cite_start]That same tightness[cite: 74]. [cite_start]That feeling that if you squeezed any harder, something would burst[cite: 75]. [cite_start]When Angela pulled free, her uniform sleeve was wet[cite: 76]. [cite_start]Not from sweat[cite: 76]. [cite_start]Catherine's palm had left a damp handprint on the fabric[cite: 77]. [cite_start]Cold and wet[cite: 77]. [cite_start]Angela tried to dry it under the heating vent[cite: 78]. [cite_start]The print stayed wet for hours[cite: 78]. [cite_start]And it smelled like pond water[cite: 79]. [cite_start]Like something that's been sitting still for too long in the dark[cite: 79].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>Day twenty-one[cite: 80]. [cite_start]The last examination[cite: 80]. [cite_start]Dr. Whitmore's notes[cite: 80]:</p>
            [cite_start]<p> "Catherine has gained twelve kilograms in three weeks[cite: 81]. [cite_start]She's dying of cancer[cite: 81]. [cite_start]She barely eats[cite: 81]. [cite_start]This is impossible[cite: 81]. [cite_start]Her skin[cite: 82]. [cite_start]I can see through it now[cite: 82]. [cite_start]I can see the veins underneath, dark blue lines[cite: 82]. [cite_start]I can see the water beneath the surface, moving in her arms and neck[cite: 83]. [cite_start]I touched her throat to check for swelling[cite: 84]. [cite_start]It felt like touching a sponge full of water[cite: 84]. [cite_start]Dense[cite: 84]. [cite_start]Heavy[cite: 84]. [cite_start]When she swallowed, I could see something moving under the skin[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Not food[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Not saliva[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Water[cite: 85]. [cite_start]Following paths that don't make anatomical sense[cite: 86]. [cite_start]Branching through her throat like tributaries[cite: 86]. [cite_start]Her eyes are the worst[cite: 87]. [cite_start]They look clouded[cite: 87]. [cite_start]Like dirty glass[cite: 87]. [cite_start]And there's water in the corners: tears, but they're not falling[cite: 88]. [cite_start]They're just gathering there[cite: 88]. [cite_start]Building up[cite: 88]. [cite_start]Waiting[cite: 88]. [cite_start]We tried to take her for imaging[cite: 89]. [cite_start]She refused[cite: 89]. [cite_start]Became agitated when we moved to disconnect the iPad[cite: 89]. [cite_start]Said she couldn't leave[cite: 90]. That she'd 'miss it.' [cite_start]That it was 'almost ready"[cite: 90].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine was retaining water[cite: 91]. [cite_start]Her body weight increasing when it should have been decreasing[cite: 91]. [cite_start]Fluid moving backward, toward pressure instead of away from it[cite: 92].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>In baptism, we say water is the medium of a new life[cite: 93]. [cite_start]Of transformation[cite: 93]. [cite_start]I don't know what Catherine was transforming into[cite: 94].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>October 9th[cite: 95]. [cite_start]3:47 AM[cite: 95].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine had been unconscious for six hours[cite: 96]. [cite_start]Her breathing had that awful pattern, the kind you hear at the end[cite: 96]. [cite_start]Long silence[cite: 97]. [cite_start]Then a gasping breath, wet and rattling[cite: 97]. [cite_start]Then silence again[cite: 97]. [cite_start]Each breath sounded like drowning[cite: 97].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily was holding her mother's hand[cite: 98]. [cite_start]Had been for three hours[cite: 98]. [cite_start]She told Dr. Whitmore later that her mother's hand was too heavy[cite: 99]. [cite_start]Too cold[cite: 99]. [cite_start]Not the normal cold of dying[cite: 99]. [cite_start]Colder than that[cite: 100]. [cite_start]Like holding something pulled from a freezer[cite: 100].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Angela was checking Catherine's vital signs every fifteen minutes[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Blood pressure jumping around[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Heart rate climbing, then dropping[cite: 101]. [cite_start]Temperature kept falling, down to 34 degrees when it should have been 36[cite: 102]. [cite_start]The room was warm, but Catherine's body was cold[cite: 102].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily said her mother's skin had changed color in those final hours[cite: 103]. [cite_start]And it was not yellow or grey like you would expect[cite: 104]. [cite_start]No, something else[cite: 104]. [cite_start]Like looking at someone through frosted glass[cite: 105]. [cite_start]Translucent[cite: 105]. [cite_start]The veins underneath were visible as dark lines running through pale skin[cite: 105]. [cite_start]And the water beneath, Emily said you could watch it moving[cite: 106]. [cite_start]Slowly[cite: 106]. [cite_start]Creeping through channels under the surface that shouldn't be there[cite: 107]. [cite_start]Catherine's face was swollen[cite: 108]. [cite_start]Puffy[cite: 108]. [cite_start]Features distorted so she barely looked like herself anymore[cite: 108]. [cite_start]Her closed eyelids bulged[cite: 108]. [cite_start]The skin around her neck was tight, stretched[cite: 109]. [cite_start]When Angela checked her pulse, she said the artery felt strange under her fingers[cite: 109]. [cite_start]Too thick[cite: 110]. [cite_start]Throbbing with too much pressure[cite: 110].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The room had changed too[cite: 111]. [cite_start]Despite the air conditioning, water had formed on the windows[cite: 111]. [cite_start]Droplets running down the glass in slow lines[cite: 112]. [cite_start]The air felt thick, heavy with moisture[cite: 112]. [cite_start]Emily's clothes stuck to her skin with dampness[cite: 113]. [cite_start]Angela's hair started curling from the humidity[cite: 113].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>The iPad was still playing[cite: 114]. [cite_start]Twenty-one days without stopping[cite: 114]. [cite_start]Emily had thought about turning it off once her mother lost consciousness[cite: 115]. [cite_start]But she didn't[cite: 115]. [cite_start]Couldn't make herself do it[cite: 115]. [cite_start]She told Dr. Whitmore later that she felt like something was watching through the screen[cite: 116]. [cite_start]Waiting[cite: 116]. [cite_start]And turning that it off would be... noticed[cite: 117].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>At 3:47 and 23 seconds, the sound changed[cite: 118]. [cite_start]Emily described the river making a different sound[cite: 119]. [cite_start]Like the sound of moving water changed[cite: 119]. [cite_start]It stopped sounding like liquid[cite: 119]. [cite_start]Started sounding like impact[cite: 120]. [cite_start]Heavy[cite: 120]. [cite_start]Like meat being thrown against something[cite: 120]. [cite_start]Each wave hitting rock wasn't a splash anymore, it was a strike[cite: 121]. [cite_start]Deliberate[cite: 121]. [cite_start]Forceful[cite: 121]. [cite_start]She said: That's what water sounds like when it stops flowing[cite: 122]. [cite_start]When it moves with intention[cite: 122].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily was still holding Catherine's hand[cite: 123]. [cite_start]The temperature dropped[cite: 124]. [cite_start]Instantly[cite: 124]. [cite_start]Between one heartbeat and the next, her mother's hand went from cold to freezing[cite: 124]. [cite_start]Not the normal cold of approaching death[cite: 125]. [cite_start]Deeper than that[cite: 125]. [cite_start]Emily said it burned[cite: 125]. [cite_start]Like touching ice[cite: 125]. [cite_start]Her fingers went numb where they made contact[cite: 126]. [cite_start]Within seconds, frostbitten[cite: 126].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The river stopped[cite: 127]. [cite_start]The livestream stayed active[cite: 128]. [cite_start]Timestamp kept updating[cite: 128]. [cite_start]A bird flew across the frame[cite: 128]. [cite_start]Trees moved in wind[cite: 128]. [cite_start]But the water stopped flowing[cite: 129]. [cite_start]Surface went flat[cite: 130]. [cite_start]Underneath, every current frozen mid-motion[cite: 130]. [cite_start]Every wave crest holding its shape[cite: 130]. [cite_start]But not still[cite: 131]. [cite_start]The foam on the waves didn't dissipate[cite: 132]. [cite_start]It held shape[cite: 132]. [cite_start]And Emily could see it moving slightly[cite: 132]. [cite_start]Pulsing[cite: 132]. [cite_start]Like muscle fibers under skin[cite: 133]. [cite_start]Like the entire river had flexed and was holding position[cite: 133].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily told Dr. Whitmore that in that moment, watching the river hold itself still, she understood something[cite: 134]. [cite_start]The river in Oregon wasn't... it[cite: 135]. [cite_start]It was just a part[cite: 135]. [cite_start]One small part[cite: 135]. [cite_start]Like a finger[cite: 135]. [cite_start]Or- or a cell[cite: 136]. [cite_start]She said she could feel it, something vast[cite: 137]. [cite_start]So vast that maybe it was all the water in the world[cite: 137]. [cite_start]Every ocean, every river, every raindrop[cite: 138]. [cite_start]All of it connected[cite: 138]. [cite_start]All of it aware[cite: 138]. [cite_start]And her mother had been watching one tiny piece of it for three weeks[cite: 139]. [cite_start]One molecule learning to recognize her[cite: 139].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The air pressure in the room changed[cite: 140]. [cite_start]Emily's ears popped[cite: 140]. [cite_start]Angela dropped her clipboard[cite: 140]. [cite_start]Said later her hands stopped working properly[cite: 141].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>The humidity spiked[cite: 142]. [cite_start]Within seconds, everything was damp[cite: 142]. [cite_start]Emily's clothes stuck to her[cite: 142]. [cite_start]Condensation appeared on the walls[cite: 142]. [cite_start]The smell, the smell... Emily described it as ancient silt[cite: 143]. [cite_start]Stagnant water[cite: 143]. [cite_start]Like opening something that had been sealed for a very, very long time[cite: 144].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine's eyes opened[cite: 145]. [cite_start]Both at once[cite: 146]. [cite_start]She sat up[cite: 146]. [cite_start]Shouldn't have been possible[cite: 147]. [cite_start]Three weeks in bed, muscles wasted, body failing and swollen with twelve kilograms of water that had nowhere to go, but she sat up smoothly[cite: 147]. [cite_start]Easily[cite: 148]. [cite_start]Like puppet strings pulling her upright[cite: 148]. [cite_start]Her neck made a wet crack when it straightened[cite: 149]. [cite_start]Not bone breaking[cite: 149]. [cite_start]Something liquid shifting position inside her throat[cite: 149].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily said in that moment, under the glow from the iPad screen, she could see everything under her mother's skin[cite: 150]. [cite_start]The water[cite: 151]. [cite_start]All of it[cite: 151]. [cite_start]Moving through her like dark rivers under ice[cite: 151]. [cite_start]And all of it gathering at her throat, pooling there[cite: 152].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Catherine's hospital gown was soaked through[cite: 153]. [cite_start]Water was coming out of her skin[cite: 153]. [cite_start]Not sweat[cite: 153]. [cite_start]Actual water[cite: 153]. [cite_start]Beading on the surface like condensation on cold glass[cite: 154]. [cite_start]Running down her arms in thin streams, dripping from her fingertips[cite: 154].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>She didn't look at Emily[cite: 155]. [cite_start]Didn't seem to know her daughter was there[cite: 155]. [cite_start]Just stared at the iPad[cite: 155]. [cite_start]At the river that had finally stopped pretending to be normal water[cite: 156].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>She opened her mouth[cite: 157]. [cite_start]The security audio is... affected[cite: 158]. [cite_start]Sounds like it was recorded underwater[cite: 158].</p>

            [cite_start]<p>Catherine collapsed[cite: 159]. [cite_start]Heart stopped at 3:47 and 47 seconds[cite: 159]. [cite_start]Twenty-four seconds after sitting up[cite: 159]. [cite_start]A couple of seconds after speaking the Tongue[cite: 160]. [cite_start]When she fell back, Emily heard something[cite: 161]. [cite_start]A sloshing sound[cite: 161]. [cite_start]Inside her mother's body[cite: 161]. [cite_start]Like a bucket of water tipping over[cite: 162]. [cite_start]All that fluid, shifting[cite: 162]. [cite_start]Settling[cite: 162].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Angela checked for a pulse[cite: 163]. [cite_start]Nothing[cite: 163]. [cite_start]Called for help even though they were a hospice, even though Catherine had signed papers saying not to[cite: 163]. [cite_start]Angela told Dr. Whitmore she needed other people in the room[cite: 164]. [cite_start]Witnesses[cite: 164]. [cite_start]Because the body was still changing[cite: 164]. [cite_start]The swelling was going down[cite: 165]. [cite_start]Fast[cite: 165]. [cite_start]Too fast[cite: 165]. [cite_start]Emily watched her mother's face[cite: 166]. [cite_start]Watched the puffiness disappear like someone was draining it[cite: 166]. [cite_start]Watched her mother's stomach flatten, the skin pulling tight over ribs that had been hidden by all that water[cite: 167]. [cite_start]But the sheets under her mother's body stayed dry[cite: 168]. [cite_start]The water wasn't coming out[cite: 169]. [cite_start]It was simply going somewhere else[cite: 169].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p>On the iPad, the river started moving again[cite: 170]. [cite_start]Like nothing had happened[cite: 170]. [cite_start]Just water over rocks[cite: 170]. [cite_start]Trees swaying[cite: 170]. [cite_start]Normal[cite: 170].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily hasn't been able to drink water since that night[cite: 171].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Angela Miller submitted an incident report the next morning[cite: 172]. [cite_start]Standard procedure for any death with unusual circumstances[cite: 172]. [cite_start]But she added a note at the bottom, handwritten[cite: 173]. [cite_start]Dr. Whitmore included it in the file she sent to the Archdiocese[cite: 173]:</p>
            [cite_start]<p> "After patient expired, the condensation on the windows remained for three hours[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Despite maintenance adjusting the room temperature[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Despite opening the door to the hallway[cite: 174]. [cite_start]The water droplets stayed on the glass[cite: 174]. [cite_start]And when I went to wipe them away with a towel before the family arrived, the moisture was cold[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Colder than the room[cite: 174]. [cite_start]Colder than the outside temperature[cite: 174]. [cite_start]And it left my hand numb for twenty minutes afterward[cite: 175]. [cite_start]I had to run it under hot water for five minutes before I could feel my fingers again"[cite: 175].</p>

            <hr>

            [cite_start]<p><span class="speaker">TOMMASO:</span> I spent six hours this morning looking for similar cases[cite: 176]. [cite_start]Anything involving water[cite: 176]. [cite_start]Aquatic manifestations[cite: 176]. [cite_start]Found twelve cases across four centuries[cite: 177]. [cite_start]Deaths near water[cite: 177]. [cite_start]Rivers, wells, rain[cite: 177]. [cite_start]People speaking the Tongue in their final moments near water[cite: 178]. [cite_start]But they're not the same[cite: 179]. [cite_start]In every one, the water was just a location[cite: 180]. [cite_start]People drowned, or were found near water after speaking[cite: 180]. [cite_start]But the water itself wasn't part of the manifestation[cite: 181]. [cite_start]Wasn't... active[cite: 181].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>This is different[cite: 182]. [cite_start]Catherine wasn't near water when she died[cite: 183]. [cite_start]She was watching it[cite: 183]. [cite_start]From a screen[cite: 183]. [cite_start]And that water, that specific river in Oregon, responded[cite: 184]. [cite_start]Stopped moving and showed her something[cite: 184].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>The Church teaches that the Tongue is the language of the threshold[cite: 185]. [cite_start]The boundary between life and death[cite: 185]. [cite_start]When someone speaks it while dying, they're perceiving what comes after[cite: 186]. [cite_start]What waits on the other side[cite: 186].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>I don't know what Catherine saw[cite: 187]. [cite_start]I don't know what was in that water[cite: 187]. [cite_start]Or if it was the water itself[cite: 188]. [cite_start]Or something using the water[cite: 188]. [cite_start]Or traveling through it[cite: 188]. [cite_start]All I know: she watched for three weeks[cite: 189]. [cite_start]And when she died, that water three thousand miles away stopped moving for seventeen seconds[cite: 189].</p>
            <p>And then there is Emily and her comment about understanding it all...? [cite_start]Some sort of revelation[cite: 190]. [cite_start]About all being... connected[cite: 190]? [cite_start]To other bodies of water and stuff like that[cite: 191]? [cite_start]I mean, why's that[cite: 191]? [cite_start]I really don't know what to think about that, considering her state of mind[cite: 192].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily Walsh is in the psychiatric ward at Johns Hopkins[cite: 193]. [cite_start]They're keeping her there not because she's suicidal, the doctors were very clear about that[cite: 194]. [cite_start]They're keeping her because she can't be near running water[cite: 195]. [cite_start]Any running water at all[cite: 196].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>First day there, a nurse turned on the bathroom faucet[cite: 197]. [cite_start]Emily had what looked like a seizure[cite: 197]. [cite_start]Full convulsions[cite: 198]. [cite_start]Body rigid, then shaking[cite: 198]. [cite_start]But the brain scan showed nothing[cite: 199]. [cite_start]No electrical activity in her brain that would cause a seizure[cite: 199]. [cite_start]The neurologist wrote: "Seizure-like symptoms with no neural cause[cite: 200]. [cite_start]Unknown origin"[cite: 200].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Emily told Dr. Whitmore what actually happened when that faucet turned on[cite: 201]. [cite_start]She heard tapping[cite: 202]. [cite_start]Rhythmic[cite: 202]. [cite_start]Deliberate[cite: 202]. [cite_start]Like fingers drumming on wood[cite: 202]. [cite_start]The water coming out of the pipe, Emily said it wasn't being pushed[cite: 203]. [cite_start]It was coming out on its own[cite: 203]. [cite_start]Moving deliberately[cite: 204]. [cite_start]Reaching for the sink basin[cite: 204]. [cite_start]When it hit the bottom, it didn't drain[cite: 205]. [cite_start]It pooled[cite: 205]. [cite_start]Started gathering at the edges[cite: 205]. [cite_start]Taking shape[cite: 205]. [cite_start]Emily said she could see it starting to form something[cite: 206]. [cite_start]To stand up in the basin[cite: 206]. [cite_start]Rising[cite: 206]. [cite_start]That's when she started seizing[cite: 207].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>She won't drink water[cite: 208]. [cite_start]Won't let it touch her skin[cite: 208]. [cite_start]Won't even cry, she's forcing herself not to cry because she's terrified of producing water from her own body[cite: 209]. [cite_start]She's dying of dehydration[cite: 210]. [cite_start]Slowly[cite: 210]. [cite_start]Kidneys failing[cite: 210]. [cite_start]Blood getting thicker[cite: 210]. [cite_start]Lips cracked and bleeding[cite: 210]. [cite_start]But she refuses[cite: 210].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Anyway, I'm going to play the recorded security audio and analyze what comes out of it[cite: 211].</p>
            [cite_start]<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">VOICE: MALETH... KHOR... [cite: 211]</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Maleth-Khor[cite: 212].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Well, that's... pretty clear, right[cite: 213]? [cite_start]I understood what it meant when I heard it[cite: 213]. [cite_start]Immediately[cite: 213]. [cite_start]I know, I know that's not supposed to happen[cite: 214]. [cite_start]Translation requires comparing dozens of cases, building context[cite: 214]. [cite_start]But I knew, at least part of it[cite: 215]. [cite_start]"Maleth" is stream, flow[cite: 215]. [cite_start]It's- it's pretty obvious[cite: 215]. [cite_start]Right[cite: 215]? [cite_start]I don't know about "Khor" and I'll try searching for references in the Lexicon[cite: 216]. But-</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Let's see... for "Khor" we have only 2 occurrences, so it's a tier three word[cite: 217]. [cite_start]Hypothetical translation is "Time"[cite: 217]. [cite_start]Of course[cite: 218]. [cite_start]So the translation should be the... the[cite: 218]...</p>
            [cite_start]<p>No, wait a second[cite: 219]. [cite_start]Let me check for Maleth and not jump to conclusions quickly[cite: 219]. [cite_start]There's no logic in the Tongue, let's not get... let's not get ahead of ourselves[cite: 220].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Maleth[cite: 221]. [cite_start]12 occurrences and- huh[cite: 221]? [cite_start]The... the pages are missing[cite: 221]. [cite_start]I can see it has 12 occurrences, it's flagged as tier three but[cite: 222]. [cite_start]The pages are missing[cite: 222]. [cite_start]They've not been torn apart [cite: 223][cite_start], they're just missing[cite: 224]. [cite_start]I- I need to ask about this, maybe my copy of the Lexicon has been modified[cite: 224]. [cite_start]Or, or something else, I mean[cite: 225]...</p>
            [cite_start]<p>Gesù[cite: 226]. [cite_start]This case is driving me insane[cite: 226].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>I'll add Maleth-Khor as a tier three word with a hypothetical translation following my gut, I guess[cite: 227]. [cite_start]It's disgusting as a linguist, but it's better than nothing for now[cite: 228].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>So at least for now: <span class="tongue">Maleth-Khor</span>[cite: 229]. [cite_start]Stream-Time[cite: 229]. [cite_start]The Flow of Time[cite: 229].</p>
            [cite_start]<p>One word added to the Lexicon[cite: 230].</p>
