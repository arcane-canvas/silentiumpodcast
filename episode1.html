                <p><span class="speaker">TOMMASO:</span> Personal research log. Father Tommaso Lanza. November 15th, 2024.</p>

                <p>Custodia Ultimae Vocis. Case reference: TM-2024-047.</p>

                <p>This is my first case. Three months into my probationary period as translator, and I'm finally being given access to primary documentation. The Custos Primus assured me this would be... straightforward. A modern case. Clear audio recording. Multiple witnesses.</p>

                <p class="note">[Pause. Papers rustling]</p>

                <p>I should establish the Church's position, as I've been instructed to do in all documentation. The official interpretation, as outlined in the Constitutio Custodiae of 390 AD, states that the Tongue is not demonic in nature. It is mystery. It is the language of the threshold between mortal life and divine presence. When the prophets heard God speak, they were terrified. When angels appeared to shepherds, they said "be not afraid" because the holy overwhelms us.</p>

                <p class="note">[Another pause]</p>

                <p>I want to believe that interpretation. I do. But...</p>

                <p class="note">[Sound of chair shifting]</p>

                <p>Let me tell you what happened to Marcus Chen.</p>

                <p><strong>Lexicon Analysis:</strong></p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li><span class="tongue">kheth</span> (17 occurrences, Tier One) - threshold, boundary, liminal space</li>
                    <li><span class="tongue">voram</span> (23 occurrences, Tier One) - witness, observer, one who sees</li>
                </ul>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Translation:</strong> "Threshold-witness" or "One who observes at the boundary"</p>

                <p><strong>Confidence Level:</strong> High (both words Tier One, context supports interpretation)</p>

                <p><strong>Church Interpretation:</strong> The sacred language identifies those who witness the threshold between life and eternal presence. A blessing upon the faithful observer.</p>

                <p><strong>Personal Notes:</strong> Why would holy language require Marcus Chen's throat to produce sounds in positions that shouldn't be anatomically possible? The attending physician noted severe tissue damage. Why does sacred speech harm the vessel?</p>
